  <div class="info3">Come help us conceive the Future of Humanitarian
    work! We, at Quicksand, are looking for collaborators to present a global perspective on the the topic
    of humanitarian crisis response.

  <div class="info1">
    However unpredictable the future may seem, many are involved with foreseeing
    and planning around the greatest challenges it holds. Be it water shortages, a frenzied climate,
    depleting resources or unstable governments, the world we live in is constantly facing complex
    humanitarian crises. As many are looking for ways to tackle the causes of these forces, join us
    in exploring how to mitigate their short-term impact on affected communities and vulnerable regions.</div>

    <div class="info1">Together, let's consider, explore, unearth the future needs of humanitarian crises and how aid
      communities will come together to face these odds.  </div>



      <div class="info1">The work will be presented at the Barbican in April 2019 as part of
        <i>The Future of Humanitarian Work</i> pop-up exhibit. By curating such diverse
        perspectives we will present an adventurous dive into the emergencies of
        tomorrow through the lived experiences of its humanitarian workers.
        Disasters, their preparedness as well their mitigation might undergo
        far more transformation than visible now.</div>

        <div  class="info1">When new technologies, social data and human error undergo further mutation in
          the coming decades, the typology of humanitarian contexts, actors and response
          will transform. The exhibit puts on a playful garb while presenting a powerful
          transmedia experience that brings to life some of these future experiences.</div>

          <div  class="info1">We have started work with our partners NID, STBY, HLA, and Tandem. </div>
